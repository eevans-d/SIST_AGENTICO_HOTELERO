## Contributing to Security Tests

### Adding New Security Tests
1. Create test file in appropriate category
2. Use existing fixtures from `conftest.py`
3. Follow naming convention `test_security_*.py`
4. Include comprehensive docstrings
5. Add to test runner configuration

### Test Development Guidelines
- Focus on security-specific scenarios
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- Validate error handling and recovery
- Include performance considerations

### Security Test Quality
- Each test should validate specific security control
- Tests should be independent and isolated
- Use realistic attack scenarios
- Include compliance validation
- Document security implications
