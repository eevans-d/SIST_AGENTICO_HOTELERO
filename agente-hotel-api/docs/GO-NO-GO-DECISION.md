## Overview

### Purpose
This framework provides a structured, objective approach to making the **Go/No-Go decision** for production launch of the Agente Hotelero IA system.

### Principles
1. **Data-Driven**: Decisions based on measurable criteria
2. **Transparent**: Clear reasoning documented
3. **Risk-Aware**: Explicit risk assessment and mitigation
4. **Collaborative**: Input from all stakeholders
5. **Accountable**: Clear ownership and sign-offs

### Decision Outcomes
- **GO**: Launch approved, proceed with confidence
- **GO WITH CAUTION**: Launch approved with enhanced monitoring
- **NO-GO**: Launch blocked until critical issues resolved

---

## Decision Criteria

### Critical Requirements (Must-Pass)

All items marked 🔴 **CRITICAL** in the production readiness checklist must achieve **100% PASS** status.

**Critical Categories**:
1. **Security** (12 critical items)
   - Production secrets rotated
   - HTTPS enforced with valid certs
   - PII encryption (at rest + in transit)
   - No HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerabilities

2. **Performance** (8 critical items)
   - Load testing completed successfully
   - Latency SLAs met (P95 < 1s, P99 < 2s)
   - Error rate < 0.1% under load
   - Resource limits configured

3. **Operations** (10 critical items)
   - Zero-downtime deployment tested
   - Automatic rollback functional
   - Database migrations safe
   - Incident detection operational
   - On-call rotation scheduled

4. **Infrastructure** (8 critical items)
   - Production servers provisioned
   - DNS configured correctly
   - Database backups automated
   - Monitoring operational

5. **Final Validation** (10 critical items)
   - All smoke tests passed
   - Load tests passed
   - Security scan clean
   - All sign-offs obtained

**Total Critical Items**: 87

### Non-Critical Requirements

Items without CRITICAL designation. Target: >95% PASS rate.

**Impact**: Not blockers individually, but pattern of failures indicates unreadiness.

---

## Scoring System

### Primary Score: Critical Items

```
Critical Score = (PASS Critical Items / Total Critical Items) × 100%

Target: 100%
Minimum: 100% (any failure = NO-GO)
```

**Example**:
- Total Critical: 87
- PASS: 87
- FAIL: 0
- **Score: 100%** ✅

### Secondary Score: All Items

```
Total Score = (PASS All Items / Total Items) × 100%

Target: 100%
GO Threshold: >95%
GO WITH CAUTION: 90-95%
NO-GO: <90%
```

**Example**:
- Total Items: 145
- PASS: 140
- PARTIAL: 3
- FAIL: 2
- **Score: 96.5%** ✅

### Weighted Score (Optional)

For more nuanced assessment:

```
Weighted Score = Σ(Category Weight × Category Score)
```

**Category Weights**:
| Category | Weight | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Security | 25% | Critical for trust and compliance |
| Performance | 20% | Direct impact on user experience |
| Operations | 20% | Essential for stability |
| Infrastructure | 15% | Foundation for all else |
| Application | 10% | Core functionality |
| Monitoring | 10% | Visibility and response |

**Example Calculation**:
```
Security:        22/22 × 25% = 25.0%
Performance:     15/15 × 20% = 20.0%
Operations:      17/18 × 20% = 18.9%
Infrastructure:  12/12 × 15% = 15.0%
Application:     14/14 × 10% = 10.0%
Monitoring:      11/12 × 10% =  9.2%
                                ------
Weighted Score:                  98.1% ✅
```

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Classification

For each FAIL or PARTIAL item, assess:

**Likelihood** (Probability the issue will manifest):
- **HIGH**: > 50% chance
- **MEDIUM**: 10-50% chance
- **LOW**: < 10% chance

**Impact** (If the issue manifests):
- **CRITICAL**: System down, data loss, security breach
- **HIGH**: Severe degradation, partial outage
- **MEDIUM**: Minor issues, workarounds available
- **LOW**: Cosmetic, minimal user impact

### Risk Matrix

| Impact ↓ / Likelihood → | LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH |
|--------------------------|-----|--------|------|
| **CRITICAL** | 🟡 Medium Risk | 🔴 High Risk | 🔴 Critical Risk |
| **HIGH** | 🟢 Low Risk | 🟡 Medium Risk | 🔴 High Risk |
| **MEDIUM** | 🟢 Low Risk | 🟢 Low Risk | 🟡 Medium Risk |
| **LOW** | 🟢 Low Risk | 🟢 Low Risk | 🟢 Low Risk |

### Risk Response Strategies

**🔴 Critical/High Risk**:
- **MUST RESOLVE** before launch
- Allocate resources immediately
- Executive escalation

**🟡 Medium Risk**:
- **RESOLVE OR MITIGATE** before launch
- Document mitigation plan
- Enhanced monitoring post-launch

**🟢 Low Risk**:
- **ACCEPT** or address post-launch
- Document known issue
- Include in backlog

### Risk Assessment Template

```markdown
## Risk: [Item ID] - [Item Description]

**Status**: ❌ FAIL / 🟡 PARTIAL

**Likelihood**: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW  
**Impact**: CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW  
**Risk Level**: 🔴 Critical / 🔴 High / 🟡 Medium / 🟢 Low

## Examples

### Example 1: GO Decision

**Scenario**: All critical items PASS, total score 98%

```
Critical Score: 100% (87/87 PASS)
Total Score: 98% (142/145 PASS)
- 142 PASS
- 2 PARTIAL (P-012 Cache hit rate 68%, DOC-009 Handover 90% complete)
- 1 FAIL (C-004 Data processing agreements pending signature)

Risk Assessment:
- P-012: 🟢 Low Risk (cache still functional, just suboptimal)
- DOC-009: 🟢 Low Risk (can complete post-launch)
- C-004: 🟡 Medium Risk (but not customer-facing data, internal only)

Decision: GO
Rationale: All critical items met. Non-critical gaps are low risk and can be 
addressed post-launch. Strong performance in security, operations, and technical
readiness give high confidence.

Conditions: None (standard monitoring)
```

### Example 2: GO WITH CAUTION Decision

**Scenario**: All critical PASS, but total score 92%

```
Critical Score: 100% (87/87 PASS)
Total Score: 92% (134/145 PASS)
- 134 PASS
- 8 PARTIAL
- 3 FAIL (non-critical)

Risk Assessment:
- A-003: Code coverage 68% (target 75%) - 🟡 Medium Risk
- P-012: Cache hit rate 65% (target 70%) - 🟡 Medium Risk  
- Multiple documentation items incomplete - 🟢 Low Risk

Decision: GO WITH CAUTION
Rationale: All critical requirements met, but multiple quality gaps create
elevated risk. Launch approved with conditions.

Conditions:
1. Enhanced monitoring for first 2 weeks (24/7 coverage)
2. Daily stand-ups to review metrics
3. Rapid response team on standby (2-hour response SLA)
4. Complete all PARTIAL items within 14 days
5. Conduct retrospective after 1 week

Enhanced Monitoring Plan:
- Check dashboards every 15 minutes (first 72h)
- Error rate alerts at 0.05% (stricter than normal 0.1%)
- Latency alerts at P95 > 800ms (stricter than normal 1s)
- On-call engineer + backup engineer both available 24/7
```

### Example 3: NO-GO Decision

**Scenario**: Critical item FAIL

```
Critical Score: 99% (86/87 PASS)
- FAIL: S-021 Security scan found 2 HIGH vulnerabilities

Total Score: 96% (139/145 PASS)

Risk Assessment:
- S-021: 🔴 Critical Risk
  - Vulnerability: SQL injection in user input (CVE-2024-XXXX)
  - Likelihood: HIGH (user-facing endpoint)
  - Impact: CRITICAL (data breach, system compromise)

Decision: NO-GO
Rationale: Critical security vulnerability is absolute blocker. Cannot launch
with known HIGH/CRITICAL security issues.

Remediation Plan:
1. [BLOCKER] Fix SQL injection vulnerability
   - Owner: Security Team
   - ETA: 2 days
   - Verification: Re-run Trivy scan, penetration test
   
2. Re-run complete security validation
   - Owner: Security Lead
   - ETA: 3 days (after fix deployed)
   
3. Re-run Go/No-Go process
   - Date: October 18, 2024
   - All other items remain valid (no re-validation needed)

New Target Launch: October 19, 2024 (pending GO decision)

Stakeholder Communication:
- Engineering: Notified, security fix in progress
- Product: Notified, launch delayed 3 days
- Marketing: Notified, delay communications (if external)
- Customer Success: Notified, internal trial extended
```

## Continuous Improvement

### Post-Launch Review

After every launch (within 1 week):
1. Review decision framework effectiveness
2. Identify improvements to checklist
3. Update risk classifications based on actual outcomes
4. Refine scoring thresholds if needed
5. Document lessons learned

### Quarterly Review

Every quarter:
1. Analyze all Go/No-Go decisions
2. Review correlation between scores and outcomes
3. Update category weights based on data
4. Refine risk matrix based on incidents
5. Update framework documentation

### Metrics to Track

- **Decision Accuracy**: Did GO decisions lead to stable launches?
- **False Negatives**: Were there issues we didn't catch?
- **False Positives**: Were NO-GO decisions too conservative?
- **Time to Decision**: How long did the process take?
- **Checklist Completeness**: Were all items relevant?
