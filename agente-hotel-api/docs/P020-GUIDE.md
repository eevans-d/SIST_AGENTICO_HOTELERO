   - Share with all team members
   - Review in team meeting
   - Answer questions

2. **Assign owners**:
   - Each of 145 items needs an owner
   - Use sign-off sheet in checklist
   - Confirm owners accept responsibility

3. **Schedule meetings**:
   - Go/No-Go meeting (T-1 day, 90 min)
   - Launch briefing (T-2h, 30 min)
   - 24h review (T+24h, 30 min)

---

### Phase 2: Validation (Day -4 to -2)

**Day -4 to -2**:
1. **Execute checklist items**:
   - Follow validation criteria

   - Update item status in checklist
   - If FAIL: immediately assess risk and create mitigation plan

2. **Risk assessment**:
   - For each FAIL or PARTIAL item:
     - Classify likelihood (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
     - Classify impact (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
     - Use risk matrix to determine risk level
     - Create mitigation plan (resolve, mitigate, or accept)

3. **Daily stand-ups** (recommended):
   - Progress update: X/145 items complete
   - Blockers: Any critical items FAIL?
   - Risk review: New risks identified?
   - Plan: What's left to do?

3. **Decision discussion** (20 min):
   - Apply decision matrix (GO / GO WITH CAUTION / NO-GO)
   - Consider overall readiness
   - Address concerns and questions

4. **Decision & sign-off** (10 min):

## Pre-Launch Process

### Checklist Execution

**Timing**: 1 week before launch (Day -7 to Day -1)

**Process**:

---

## Launch Procedures

### Zero-Downtime Deployment

**Method**: Rolling update with health checks

**Process**:
1. New containers start alongside old containers
2. New containers pass health checks (30-60 seconds)
3. Load balancer sends traffic to new containers
4. Old containers drain existing connections (30 seconds)
5. Old containers stop after drain period

**Commands**:
```bash
# Deploy with zero downtime
docker compose up -d --no-deps --build agente-api

# Monitor deployment
watch -n 2 'docker compose ps'

# Validate health
curl -f http://localhost:8000/health/ready
```

### Rollback Decision

**When to Rollback**:
- **Immediate** (within 30 min):
  - Error rate >5%
  - P95 latency >3s
  - Critical service down
  - Data corruption detected
  
- **Considered** (30min-2h):
  - Error rate 1-5% (investigate first)
  - P95 latency 2-3s
  - Non-critical service degraded

- **No Rollback** (after 2h):
  - Error rate <1%
  - Latency within SLAs
  - Fixable with hotfix

**Rollback Commands**:
```bash
# 1. Announce rollback
# Slack: "🚨 ROLLBACK INITIATED - Reason: [X]"

# 2. Execute rollback
docker compose rollback agente-api

# 3. Validate rollback
./scripts/validate-deployment.sh production

# 4. Announce completion
# Slack: "✅ ROLLBACK COMPLETE - Status: [Healthy]"
```
