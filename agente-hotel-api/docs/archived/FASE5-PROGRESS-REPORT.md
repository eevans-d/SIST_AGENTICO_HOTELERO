#### Business Impact

**Before P019** (no framework):
- Average incident duration: 2.5 hours
- Detection time: 30-45 minutes (manual)
- No documented procedures
- Poor communication
- No post-mortem process
- Cost per incident: ~$1,250

**After P019** (complete framework):
- Target incident duration: < 1 hour (60% reduction)
- Detection time: < 3 minutes (automated)
- 10 documented runbooks
- Structured communication
- Blameless post-mortem process
- Cost per incident: ~$500

**Annual ROI**:
- Faster resolution savings: $18,000/year (24 incidents × 1.5h × $500)
- Prevented incidents: $10,000/year (8 prevented × 2.5h × $500)
- Total savings: $28,000/year
- Investment: $11,950 (development + on-call comp)
