## ðŸš€ Deployment Process

### Phase 1: Pre-Deployment Validation

```bash
# Run comprehensive validation
make validate-deployment

# Verify all checks pass
echo "Validation complete - review output for any issues"
```

### Phase 2: Staging Deployment (Recommended)

```bash
# Deploy to staging first
make deploy-staging

# Run smoke tests on staging
curl -f http://staging.yourdomain.com/health/ready
```

### Phase 3: Production Deployment

```bash
# Option A: Standard deployment
make deploy-production

# Option B: Canary deployment (recommended)
make canary-deploy
```

### Phase 4: Post-Deployment Validation

```bash
# Check deployment status
make deployment-status

# Verify health endpoints
curl -f https://yourdomain.com/health/ready
curl -f https://yourdomain.com/health/live

# Monitor key metrics
make validate-slo-compliance
```

## ðŸ”§ Common Pre-Deployment Issues

### Issue: Environment Variables Not Set
**Symptoms**: Application fails to start with validation errors
**Solution**: 
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.production`
2. Replace all `REPLACE_WITH_*` values with real credentials
3. Run `make validate-deployment` to verify

### Issue: Docker Build Failures
**Symptoms**: Production Docker build fails
**Solution**:
1. Ensure `requirements-prod.txt` is up to date
2. Check `Dockerfile.production` syntax
3. Build locally: `make build-production`

### Issue: Database Connection Failures
**Symptoms**: Application can't connect to PostgreSQL/MySQL
**Solution**:
1. Verify database credentials in `.env.production`
2. Ensure databases are running: `docker compose ps`
3. Check network connectivity between containers

### Issue: External Service Integration Failures
**Symptoms**: WhatsApp/Gmail/PMS integration not working
**Solution**:
1. Verify API credentials are correct and not expired
2. Check network connectivity to external services
3. Review service-specific authentication requirements

## ðŸ“Š Success Criteria

The deployment is considered successful when:

- [ ] All health endpoints return 200 OK
- [ ] SLO compliance is >95% across all metrics
- [ ] No critical alerts firing
- [ ] Key user journeys working end-to-end
- [ ] Performance metrics within acceptable ranges
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting operational

## ðŸ†˜ Emergency Procedures

### Immediate Rollback
```bash
# If deployment fails or critical issues arise
cd /home/runner/work/SIST_AGENTICO_HOTELERO/SIST_AGENTICO_HOTELERO/agente-hotel-api
./scripts/rollback.sh

# Or manual rollback
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml down
# Restore from backup
# Restart previous version
```
