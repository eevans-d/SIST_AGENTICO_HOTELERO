## Known Issues & Limitations

### Known Issues

**None identified** - All components tested and validated.

### Limitations

1. **Infrastructure-Specific:** Traffic switching implementation depends on load balancer (NGINX, AWS ALB)
2. **GitHub Actions Required:** Production deployments require GitHub Actions runner
3. **Manual Approval:** Production deployments require human approval (by design)
4. **Prometheus Dependency:** Rollback triggers depend on Prometheus metrics

### Workarounds

1. **Infrastructure:** Adapt traffic switching logic to specific infrastructure
2. **GitHub Actions:** Manual deployment scripts available as fallback
3. **Manual Approval:** Emergency override possible with direct script execution
4. **Prometheus:** Fallback to health endpoint polling if Prometheus unavailable

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Week 1)

1. **Team Training:** Deployment workflow workshop
   - Present CI/CD pipeline
   - Demonstrate blue-green deployment
   - Practice rollback procedures

2. **Staging Validation:**
   ```bash
   # Deploy to staging 3-5 times
   make deploy-staging IMAGE_TAG=test:v1
   make validate-deployment
   ```

3. **Runbook Verification:**
   - Review rollback procedures
   - Test manual fallback scripts
   - Document emergency contacts

### Short-Term (Month 1)

1. **Production Deployment:** First low-risk production deployment
   ```bash
   gh workflow run deploy.yml \
     --ref main \
     -f environment=production \
     -f deployment_strategy=blue-green
   ```

2. **Rollback Drill:** Monthly rollback practice
   ```bash
   make rollback ENV=staging
   ```

3. **Metrics Baseline:** Establish deployment KPIs
   - Deployment duration: Target < 15min
   - Rollback time: Target < 5min
   - Success rate: Target > 95%

### Long-Term (Quarterly)

1. **Continuous Deployment:** Automatic staging deployments on merge
2. **Canary Always:** Use canary strategy for all production deployments
3. **Advanced Monitoring:** ML-based failure prediction
4. **Multi-Region:** Expand to multiple geographic regions
