## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Incident Detection System
**File**: `scripts/incident-detector.py` (570 lines)

**Architecture**:
```python
class IncidentDetector:
    def __init__(self, prometheus_url):
        self.client = PrometheusConnect(url=prometheus_url)
        self.rules = self._load_detection_rules()
        self.history = []
    
    def run_detection_cycle(self):
        # Check all rules
        # Classify severity
        # Send alerts
        # Track history
```

**Detection Rules** (10 total):
```python
DETECTION_RULES = [
    {
        "name": "service_down",
        "query": "up{job='agente-api'}",
        "threshold": 1,
        "comparison": "<",
        "duration": 60,
        "severity": "CRITICAL"
    },
    # ... 9 more rules
]
```

**Alert Integration**:
- Slack webhook: `POST https://hooks.slack.com/services/...`
- PagerDuty: Triggered via webhook for SEV1/SEV2
- Email: Via SMTP to incident-response@company.com

**Features Implemented**:
- ✅ Prometheus query execution via `prometheus-api-client`
- ✅ Threshold comparison with configurable duration
- ✅ Severity classification (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- ✅ Alert deduplication (5-minute window)
- ✅ Incident history persistence (JSON file)
- ✅ Auto-resolution when metrics recover
- ✅ Incident report generation (JSON/text)
- ✅ CLI interface (`--once`, `--report`, `--webhook-url`, `--interval`)

**Testing**:
```bash
# Unit tests
pytest tests/incident/test_incident_response.py::TestIncidentDetection -v

# Integration test
make incident-detect
make incident-report
```

**Metrics**:
- Detection latency: < 3 minutes (rule evaluation 60-600s + alert 15s)
- False positive rate: Target < 5% (tuned thresholds)
- Alert delivery: < 5 seconds (webhook timeout 10s)

   - Escalation: If can't resolve in 30 min

2. **Multiple Simultaneous Alerts**
   - Response: Triage by severity, address SEV1 first
   - Decision: Call Secondary for parallel response
   - Escalation: Call IC if overwhelmed

3. **Uncertain About Severity**
   - Response: Assume higher severity, escalate to Secondary
   - Decision: Better safe than sorry

### Manual Validation
- ✅ All runbooks reviewed by 2+ engineers
- ✅ Communication templates validated by stakeholders
- ✅ Incident detector tested with real Prometheus data
- ✅ Post-mortem template used for test incident
- ✅ On-call handoff process tested with team
- ✅ RTO/RPO procedures validated in staging

### Smoke Tests
```bash
# Incident detection
$ make incident-detect
✅ Checked 10 rules, 0 incidents detected

# Incident report
$ make incident-report
✅ Generated report: .playbook/incident_report.json

# Runbook validation
$ for runbook in docs/runbooks/*.md; do
>   echo "Checking $runbook..."
>   markdown-link-check "$runbook"
> done
✅ All links valid

# Post-mortem creation
$ make post-mortem
Incident ID: INC-20241015-001
Incident Title: Test Incident
✅ Created: docs/post-mortems/INC-20241015-001-Test-Incident.md
```

## Known Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Manual Runbook Execution**: Runbooks require human execution (no auto-remediation)
   - **Impact**: Human response time still required
   - **Mitigation**: Clear, step-by-step instructions
   - **Future**: Auto-remediation for common issues (P020 roadmap)

2. **Single Prometheus Instance**: No fallback if Prometheus unavailable
   - **Impact**: Detection system down if Prometheus down
   - **Mitigation**: Prometheus has own high availability
   - **Future**: Multiple Prometheus instances with failover

3. **JSON History Storage**: Not scalable for long-term storage
   - **Impact**: File size grows over time
   - **Mitigation**: Manual cleanup, 90-day retention
   - **Future**: Move to PostgreSQL table

4. **Manual Escalation Triggers**: Humans decide when to escalate
   - **Impact**: Delayed escalation if responder uncertain
   - **Mitigation**: Clear escalation criteria in runbooks
   - **Future**: Automated escalation after time thresholds

5. **No AI-Powered Triage**: Severity classification based on fixed rules
   - **Impact**: May miss complex patterns
   - **Mitigation**: Rules tuned based on historical data
   - **Future**: Machine learning for anomaly detection

### Workarounds Documented
- All limitations documented in runbooks
- Fallback procedures provided
- Manual override procedures defined

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
- ✅ Structured approach (detection → response → recovery → learning)
- ✅ Comprehensive runbook coverage (10 scenarios)
- ✅ Blameless post-mortem culture embedded early
- ✅ Clear RTO/RPO targets defined upfront
- ✅ Automation via Makefile commands
- ✅ Test-driven development for detector

### Challenges Overcome
- **Challenge**: Balancing runbook detail vs. readability
  - **Solution**: Standard structure, clear sections, TL;DR at top
- **Challenge**: Alert fatigue (too many low-priority alerts)
  - **Solution**: Tuned thresholds, severity classification, deduplication
- **Challenge**: On-call compensation fairness
  - **Solution**: Stipend + incident response pay + comp days

### Best Practices Established
1. **Blameless Culture**: Focus on systems, not people
2. **Template-Driven**: Consistency in runbooks, post-mortems, communication
3. **Automation-First**: CLI tools for all common tasks
4. **Test Everything**: Even detection rules have unit tests
5. **Document As You Go**: Runbooks updated during incidents
6. **Iterate Based on Feedback**: Post-mortem action items tracked
