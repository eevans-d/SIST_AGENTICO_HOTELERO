## Technical Implementation

### Validation Framework

**145-Item Checklist Structure**:
```
Category → Items → Validation Criteria → Evidence → Status
```

**Example Item**:
```markdown
### S-001: Production Secrets Rotated

**Category**: Security  
**Priority**: 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Owner**: Security Team  
**Target Date**: Day -7

**Validation Criteria**:
- All secrets rotated within last 90 days
- No default/example values in production
- Secrets stored in secure vault (not .env files)
- Access logs reviewed (no unauthorized access)

**Evidence**:
- Screenshot of secrets management tool (last rotation dates)
- Audit log showing secret rotation
- Production .env file inspection (no secrets present)

**Status**: ⬜ PENDING → ✅ PASS
```

---

### Decision Algorithm

**Scoring Calculation**:
```python
def calculate_scores(checklist):
    critical_items = [item for item in checklist if item.priority == "CRITICAL"]
    total_items = checklist
    
    critical_pass = sum(1 for item in critical_items if item.status == "PASS")
    total_pass = sum(1 for item in total_items if item.status == "PASS")
    
    critical_score = (critical_pass / len(critical_items)) * 100
    total_score = (total_pass / len(total_items)) * 100
    
    return critical_score, total_score

def make_decision(critical_score, total_score, risks):
    if critical_score < 100:
        return "NO-GO", "Critical items not met"
    
    if any(risk.level == "CRITICAL" or risk.level == "HIGH" for risk in risks):
        return "NO-GO", "Unmitigated critical/high risks"
    
    if total_score >= 95 and not risks:
        return "GO", "All criteria met"
    
    if 90 <= total_score < 95:
        return "GO WITH CAUTION", "Enhanced monitoring required"
    
    return "NO-GO", "Total score below threshold"
```

---

### Deployment Process

**Zero-Downtime Pattern**:
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  agente-api:
    deploy:
      replicas: 2
      update_config:
        parallelism: 1          # Update 1 at a time
        delay: 30s              # Wait 30s between updates
        order: start-first      # Start new before stopping old
      rollback_config:
        parallelism: 1
        delay: 10s
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8000/health/live"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 40s
```

**Rollback Command**:
```bash
# Automated rollback (if deployment fails health checks)
docker compose rollback agente-api

# Manual rollback
docker compose down
docker compose up -d --no-deps --build agente-api
```

---

- **Mitigation**: Intensive 48-hour monitoring catches unknown issues
- **Impact**: LOW (comprehensive coverage + monitoring safety net)

### Decision Framework

🟡 **Subjective Risk Assessment**:
- **Limitation**: Likelihood and impact classification requires judgment
- **Mitigation**: Multi-stakeholder review reduces bias
- **Impact**: LOW (multiple perspectives improve accuracy)

### Launch Runbook

🟡 **Environment-Specific**:
- **Limitation**: Commands may differ for different hosting environments
- **Mitigation**: Runbook provides patterns, adapt to environment
- **Impact**: LOW (standard Docker Compose patterns widely applicable)

### Monitoring Plan

🟡 **Resource Intensive** (First 48h):
- **Limitation**: Requires significant team coverage (all hands T+0-2h)
- **Mitigation**: Clear roles and rotation schedule
- **Impact**: LOW (only 48 hours, worth the risk reduction)
