## Business Impact & ROI

### Before P019 (No Incident Framework)
- ❌ Average incident duration: **2.5 hours**
- ❌ Detection time: **30-45 minutes** (manual monitoring)
- ❌ No documented procedures → ad-hoc responses
- ❌ Poor communication → stakeholder confusion
- ❌ No post-mortem process → repeated incidents
- ❌ High responder stress → burnout
- **Cost**: ~$1,250 per incident (2.5h × $500/hour)

### After P019 (Complete Framework)
- ✅ Target incident duration: **< 1 hour** (60% reduction)
- ✅ Detection time: **< 5 minutes** (automated)
- ✅ Documented runbooks → consistent responses
- ✅ Structured communication → stakeholder confidence
- ✅ Post-mortem process → continuous improvement
- ✅ Lower responder stress → better retention
- **Cost**: ~$500 per incident (1h × $500/hour)

### Annual ROI Calculation

**Assumptions**:
- Incidents per year: 24 (2 per month)
- Revenue loss per hour: $500
- Prevented incidents via improvements: 8 per year

**Savings**:
- Faster resolution: 24 × 1.5 hours × $500 = **$18,000/year**
- Prevented incidents: 8 × 2.5 hours × $500 = **$10,000/year**
- **Total Annual Savings**: **$28,000/year**

**Investment**:
- Development time: 90 hours @ $75/hour = $6,750
- On-call compensation increase: $5,200/year ($100/week × 52)
- **Total First-Year Cost**: $11,950

**ROI**: ($28,000 - $11,950) / $11,950 = **134% first-year ROI**
