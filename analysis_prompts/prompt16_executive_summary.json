  "executive_summary": {
    "project_overview": "SIST_AGENTICO_HOTELERO (Agente Hotel API) is a multi-service hotel receptionist AI agent built with FastAPI that handles guest communications via WhatsApp and Gmail. The system integrates with QloApps PMS for reservation management and uses Docker Compose for orchestration. The architecture follows an orchestrator pattern coordinating between message processing, NLP intent classification, PMS integration, and response generation. The system includes comprehensive observability with Prometheus/Grafana monitoring, distributed locking via Redis, and circuit breaker patterns for resilience.\n\nThe codebase consists of approximately 3,330 lines of Python code across 66 files, organized into clear service boundaries (core, services, models, routers). It demonstrates production-ready patterns including structured logging, health checks, rate limiting, security headers, and secret validation. The infrastructure is container-native with health checks, resource limits, and multi-stage builds.",
    "key_strengths": [
      "Well-structured architecture with clear separation of concerns (orchestrator, adapters, services)",
      "Comprehensive observability stack (Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, structured logging)",
      "Resilience patterns implemented (circuit breaker, retry with exponential backoff, distributed locks)",
      "Security-conscious design (SecretStr for secrets, CSP headers, input sanitization, signature verification)",
      "Production-ready deployment automation (Makefile with 46 targets, preflight checks, canary deployment support)",
      "Feature flag system for gradual rollout",
      "Dynamic tenant resolution with caching",
      "Extensive documentation (10+ doc files covering architecture, deployment, troubleshooting)"
    ],
    "key_concerns": [
      "NLP engine uses mock responses - Rasa integration is commented out, limiting AI capabilities",
      "Admin endpoints lack authentication/authorization - security gap for production",
      "No database migration system (Alembic) - schema changes require manual coordination",
      "Gmail integration incomplete (TODO in message_gateway.py)",
      "Horizontal scalability limited by stateful session management design",
      "No automated rollback mechanism",
      "Test coverage metrics not tracked or reported",
      "PII handling and data retention policies not documented"
    ],
    "technology_maturity": "Modern and production-ready stack. Uses latest stable versions: Python 3.12, FastAPI 0.111, SQLAlchemy 2.0 (async), Pydantic v2, Redis 7, PostgreSQL 14. Docker-native with proper health checks. Monitoring stack is industry-standard (Prometheus/Grafana). Code quality tools are current (Ruff, pre-commit). The architecture demonstrates understanding of cloud-native patterns (12-factor app, health checks, structured logging, metrics).",
